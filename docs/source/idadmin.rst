Term type is used by ClinicalTermMap Admins to make sure National library of Medicine terminology is up to date on a monthly basis.

**Note**: Throughout the year US Library updates. ClinicalTermMap by NUSIV will update the RXCUI lookup table data in the cloud, if there are any mismatches, it will be updated.CHS or other client, they have an EHR they have to update the data in ,each hospital logs sends their databases as an import and then we give back to the same file. We don't want to chane the format they send us - if ther is a duplicate, there will not be a problem.
